## Collections Ontology

The Collections Ontology (CO) defines unordered collections (Set and Bag) and ordered collections (or List). This ontology has been inspired by the work "Putting OWL in Order: Patterns for Sequences in OWL" by Drummond et al. (OWL-ED 2006).

## Alignment for the [VIVO semantic web tool for research discovery](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO)
To represent and model sets and sequences for research output authors for the VIVO ontology, this projects implements an alignment with the collections ontology.
This to circumvent the limitation set on [reserved RDF IRIs for OWL 2 DL ontologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Ontology_IRI_and_Version_IRI).
